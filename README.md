## About

MovieWar is a small terminal game. It's similar to "The Price Is Right"
but players guess movie release dates.

Here is a screenshot:

Interesting features:

* Singleplayer or multiplayer (any number of players supported).
* More than 7600 movies in the included database.
* Two game modes: random movies or each player chooses a movie for the rest to guess.
* Automatically uses [OMDB][] to find unknown movies and updates the database with them.
* Optional color support, using [Colorama][].

## Status

This program is finished!

MovieWar is feature-complete and has no known bugs. Unless issues are reported
I plan no further development on it other than maintenance.
